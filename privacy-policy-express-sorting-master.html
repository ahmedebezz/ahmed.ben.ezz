<strong>Privacy Policy</strong><p>This privacy policy applies to the Express Sorting Master app (hereby referred to as "Application") for mobile devices that was created by U.V.S.Team (hereby referred to as "Service Provider") as a Free service. This service is intended for use "AS IS".</p><br>

<strong>Information Collection and Use</strong>
<p>The Application does not collect any personal information from users.</p>
<p>The Application contains advertisements served by third-party advertising networks (including Google AdMob via Google Play Services).

  <li>Device type and operating system</li>
  <li>General usage data about how you interact with ads (e.g., impressions and clicks)</li>
  <li>Approximate location (derived from IP address) for ad targeting purposes</li>
</ul>
<p>No precise geolocation data is collected by the Application.</p>
<p>The Service Provider does not receive or store any of this advertising-related data directly. All collection and use of data for advertising purposes is handled by the third-party ad providers in accordance with their own privacy policies.</p><br>

<strong>Third Party Services</strong>

</ul>
<p>Please review the privacy policy of the above service for details on how they collect, use, and share data for advertising purposes.</p><br>

<p>The Service Provider may disclose automatically collected, anonymized information:</p>
<ul>
  <li>as required by law, such as to comply with a subpoena or similar legal process;</li>
  <li>when they believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect their rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond to a government request.</li>
</ul><br>

<strong>Opt-Out Rights</strong>
<p>You can stop all collection of information by the Application easily by uninstalling it. You may use the standard uninstall processes available on your mobile device or via the mobile application marketplace.</p>

</ul><br>

<strong>Data Retention</strong>

<p>Advertising partners retain data according to their own policies.</p><br>

<strong>Children</strong>
<p>The Application does not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13 years of age. If we discover that a child under 13 has provided personal information, we will immediately delete it. If you are a parent or guardian and believe your child has provided us with personal information, please contact us at the email below.</p><br>
